# Lung Cancer EDA – Task 2 🫁📊

## Overview 🌐
Performed data cleaning and EDA on the **Lung Cancer Detection** dataset from Kaggle.  
Explored relationships between symptoms, risk factors, and lung cancer occurrence to identify patterns and trends.

## Dataset 📁
- **Name:** Lung Cancer Detection  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/lung-cancer-detection)  
- **Example columns:** `Gender`, `Age`, `Smoking`, `Coughing`, `Chest_Pain`, `LUNG_CANCER` target

## What I Implemented ✅
- Loaded dataset using `pandas` and inspected structure (rows, columns, data types).  
- Cleaned data (handled missing values, fixed labels, converted types).  
- Plotted:
  - 📊 Count plots for categorical features (smoking, gender, symptoms).  
  - 📈 Histograms for continuous features (age).  
  - 🔗 Cross-tabs, grouped bars, and correlation heatmap for relationships.  
- Added titles, labels, and styling for readability.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
